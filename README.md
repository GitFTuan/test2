# TCFAN
Deep learning-based multi-functional therapeutic peptides prediction wih an imbalance-compensating weighted loss funcation


## Introduction
In this paper, we develop a novel deep neural network-based MLC model named TCFAN to predict MFPTs. This work has the following advantages over existing methods: 
(1) In the TCFAN model, semantic-based and position-based embedding combined with MHSA could capture more peptide sequence information, and TextCNN could extract the more effective information of peptide sequence. 
(2) To handle the imbalance dataset and improve the prediction performance, we designed a novel loss function for MLC based on FL and DL. The novel loss function dynamically assigns weights to labels by exploiting label correlations. 
(3) For the interpretability of the TCFAN model, we construct a student model and utilize knowledge distillation to improve the transparency of the TCFAN model, and visualize the key amino acids (AAs) in the peptide sequence that are important on MFTPs prediction.
